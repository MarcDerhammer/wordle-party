# wordle-party

[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) has become a huge hit!  Especially in the office.. so much that we've been doing whiteboard Wordle at lunch time.

I wanted to make it a little easier so I built a Jackbox-style version that anyone can join via Room code to make guesses.

Server is [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

Front end is [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

Pretty barebones

Features:
- Wordle
- Guess with friends in a Room
- Random words or a user can choose the next word
- History

Todo:
- Option for "voting" or something (instead of anarchy)?
- Room passcodes
- User-specific history
